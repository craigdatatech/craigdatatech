**Hi I’m Craig, a proactive Data Analyst who loves uncovering new perspectives by identifying stories, patterns and trends.**

Curiosity and determination are a big part of my personality and I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when analysing, transforming and visualising data; those insights really make a difference.

I have work experience using SQL, Tableau and Excel to gain insight in customer retention and changes in client base, to ultimately make business decisions to maximise profit and retain clients. 

I'm currently looking for new roles, so please don't hesitate to get in contact and visit my portfolio.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak English, Spanish and Portuguese!
